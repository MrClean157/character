Character
=========

The goal of this project is to create a digital character sheet for playing Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition that removes the writing, erasing, and printing of paper character sheets. 

## Features (planned)

including, but not limited to:

- automation of ability score mods, skills, proficiency, etc.
- built-in way of handling attack/damage mods for melee, ranged, spells
- use of Markdown to format descriptions
- custom macro language for adding numbers together?
	- in a description: "Adds [{DEX} + 3] to AC"
	- would resolve, if Dex mod was 3, to: "Adds 6 to AC"


## TODO

- Test various layouts for best mobile use
- Nail down data model
- Work on custom parser?
